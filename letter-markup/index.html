    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
<!title is h1 class>

    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>

    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

      <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>


<!OMG this hurt my head.... translate p, ul, ol, dl, li, dd, dt
(p) element represents a paragraph.
(ul)element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.
(ol) element represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a numbered list.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol
(dl)
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl

(li) element is used to represent an item in a list. (li vs ul)
OMG YES I FIX IT!
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li

(dd)element provides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term (dt) in a description list (dl). (what is this?)
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li

(dt)
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dt
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol


sub (fix the chem numbers, same exampe)
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/sub


>


    <ol>
      <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
      <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
      <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
      <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
      <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
      <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
      <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
      <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>For more of my research, see my <a href="http://www.example.com" title="Dr Gaye's exotic dance research">exotic dance research page</a>.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<!Add inline semantics (Inline text semantics-
Use the HTML inline text semantic to define the meaning, structure, or style of a word, line, or any arbitrary piece of text.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

, Once the block and structural semantics are in place, add all inline semantic markup to add additional context to the content.

1) The names of the sender and receiver (and "Tel" and "Email") should be marked up with strong importance.(strong)

2) The four dates:
-20 January 2016
-9 September 2016
-15 January 2017
-2 May 2017

in the document should be given appropriate elements containing machine-readable dates.

3)The first address and first date in the letter should be given a class attribute value of "sender-column"; the CSS you added previously will then cause these to be right aligned, as should be the case in a classic letter layout.

define class- use class

4) The five acronyms/abbreviations 
PhD? (NOT UNDERLINE NO U!)---C fixed
HTML ---C
CSS ---C
BC  ---C
ESQ ---C

in the main text of the letter should be marked up to provide expansions of each acronym/abbreviatio

5)The six sub/superscripts should be marked up appropriately — in the chemical formulae, and the numbers 103 and 104 (they should be 10 to the power or 3 and 4, respectively).


Clean note one more time--C
re check---c
